Network Traffic Anomaly Detector (NTAD) 🛡️An Intelligent Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that leverages Machine Learning to identify malicious activities and anomalies within network traffic flows.📌 Project OverviewThe goal of this project is to build a robust system capable of distinguishing between normal network behavior and various types of cyber-attacks. By analyzing network flow features, the model can detect signatures of potential threats with high precision.Detected Attack Types:DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)Port ScanningBrute ForceInfiltrationData Exfiltration⚙️ System ArchitectureThe pipeline consists of five key stages:Data Collection: Using industry-standard datasets such as CIC-IDS2017, NSL-KDD, or UNSW-NB15.Feature Engineering: Processing raw traffic data into meaningful features (e.g., Packet size, Flow duration, Inter-arrival times).Model Training: Training supervised models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) or unsupervised models (e.g., Autoencoders) for anomaly detection.Detection Engine: A core logic that classifies incoming traffic as Normal or Anomalous.Visualization: A real-time dashboard for monitoring traffic statistics and attack alerts.🛠️ Tech StackLanguage: Python 3.9+Machine Learning: scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlowData Processing: Pandas, NumPyNetwork Analysis: Scapy, PySharkDashboard: Streamlit🚀 Getting StartedPrerequisitesClone the repository and install the dependencies:Bashgit clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/NETWORK-TRAFFIC-ANALYZER.git
